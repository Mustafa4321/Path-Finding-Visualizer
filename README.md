# Path Finding Visualizer

Welcome to Pathfinding Visualizer! I built this application because I was fascinated by pathfinding algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool just as much as I enjoyed building it. You can access it here (use Google Chrome!):https://mustafa4321.github.io/Path-Finding-Visualizer/

## Algorithm Explained

Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a weighted graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. For a given source node in the graph, the algorithm finds the shortest path between that node and every other. It can also be used for finding the shortest paths from a single node to a single destination node by stopping the algorithm once the shortest path to the destination node has been determined.

## Tutorial of Project
start node = green node
end node = red node
yellow = shortest path 
blue = visited nodes
black = wall

This visualization of dijkstra shows the shortest path to the start and end node shown on the grid. Click on any part of the grid to create wall then click the visualize button to start the animation which will go around the wall and spread out until it reaches the end node. Finally showing the shortest path as the yellow nodes.
